# The Colonist translation validator

## Description
This is a small validator i made to check that the translation has all the tags and parameters as the original english phrase.
I tested it and should work as expected, if you find a bug please [report it](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/TheColonistsItalian/issues).

## How to use
You need Python 3.6/3.7 to use this validator.
Download the two .py files and launch the main with the command:
```
python main.py filename.csv
```
**Remember:** you need to use it on **your** csv file, **not the main one** with **all* the languages.
Simply go to **your** sheet and export it using File -> Download as -> Comma-separated values.
