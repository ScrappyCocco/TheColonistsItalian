By default, the location of unrevealed natural resources are also indicated on the map. These can help you decide in which direction to expand and navigate your expeditions.

HelpPanel_27,Text,,"This sub-panel shows you the current productivity of your colony. This is the percentage of your production buildings that are currently active.

You can also view your colony productivity over the last week or month on the graph.",,,570
HelpPanel_28,Text,,"This sub-panel lists resources recently delivered to a production building. You can filter the results by 'On Time', 'Warning' and 'Alert' and you can select any entry to see the route it took. The percentage number indicates the time the journey took compared to the time needed to maintain 100% productivity at the destination building.

For example, a <bd>Lumberjack Hut</bd> requires <it>Energy</it> at a rate of one per day and can store up to four <it>Energy</it> resources as a buffer. If an <it>Energy</it> resource takes 4.5 days to arrive, it will be listed here as 112% as if that journey time was consistent then resources wouldn't arrive quickly enough to maintain 100% productivity.

This is just one factor When taking into account whether a building can work at 100% as you also need to take into account whether there is enough of that resource being produced in the first place.

It is usually optimal to place a building that supply another building close together so that supply routes are short. Sometimes this is not possible but to work around this you can build <bd>Storage Yards</bd> near your destination to create an extra supply 'buffer'.

For example, if you have a remote <bd>Mine</bd>, you can build a nearby <bd>Storage Yard</bd> to keep a supply of <it>Energy</it> nearby. If you do this bear in mind that, by default, the <it>Energy</it> stored there will still be available to other buildings, potentially far away. There are two options to make it so that <it>Energy</it> only goes to that <bd>Mine</bd>:

Firstly you could limit the export buildings in the <bd>Storage Yard</bd> settings to just your <bd>Mine</bd>. Secondly you could create a transport rule on a road post to only allow <it>Energy</it> to pass through if going to a <bd>Storage Yard</bd>.",,,571
HelpPanel_29,Text,,"By default, resource priorities are determined by the order set in the demands panel for each resource.

However, you can also prioritise a single building over all others by using this button (or holding <hotkey>[P]</hotkey> and clicking the building).

Once prioritised, a pink star will appear above the building and it will appear at the top of the demand list of all resources that it is trying to source.

For example, if you have a Level 1 Watchtower that you wish to build as quickly as possible then Prioritising your Watchtower will mean it receives all available Logs produced ahead of any other buildings that may also currently need Logs.

You are able to set one Priority building per building type.",,,572

Store_Description,Text,,"The Colonists is a relaxing settlement building game inspired by classic titles like The Settlers and the Anno series.

Take on a series of individual missions or build your colony unfettered by any constraints in the [b]sandbox mode[/b].

You take control of a team of self-replicating robots built to simulate human civilisation.  After escaping Earth, The Colonists are now free to roam the galaxy in search of a new home and construct their dream settlement.

You'll advance through three different Ages as you build infrastructure for your colony by constructing road, boat and train transport systems.

Harvest natural resources, set up farming and food production, create expeditions to discover new lands and research new technologies.

With two separate mission tracks, The Colonists lets either you create sprawling settlements in peace or race to compete against AI colonies in military winner-takes-all scenarios.

Explore, research, manage, tweak and refine to your heart's content.

An extensive map editor and Steam Workshop support is included, so you can create, share and play custom maps.",,,1565
